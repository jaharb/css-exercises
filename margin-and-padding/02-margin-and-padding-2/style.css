/* If you say nothing about border, you get the black default 2 pixel border */
/* If you say just border-color, that works */
/* If you say border: 5x purple, it does NOT work, because more specific border things are said in user agent


/* margin-bottom: 20px; */ /* adding margin bottom didn't add space between button and parent div, it added it below parent.
                                had to get space below button via padding in container. WHY????? */
