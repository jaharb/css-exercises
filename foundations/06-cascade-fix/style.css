/* Moved the following up, because font-size was overriding small-para font size
   So an element that had both para and small para gets both sets of properties, so
   one rule's font size has to win. Since .para was later, it's thing was winning.
   So the whole issue with overriding is not a simple as the *same* rule being
   repeated later in the file, it is more likely when the same property gets pulled
   in from multiple rules, the latest applicable rule wins
